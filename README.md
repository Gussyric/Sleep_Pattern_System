ðŸ“ŒSleep Pattern SystemðŸ“Œ

Overview
This project investigates how sleep patterns impact Heart Rate Variability (HRV), a key biomarker for stress, recovery, and overall well-being. Using publicly available online datasets, we analyze HRV variations across different sleep patterns and correlate them with reported sleep quality.

Project Type
Category: Data Collection & Analysis
Skills Covered: Data Processing, Statistical Analysis
Tools & Technologies:
Programming: Python
Analysis: Google Colab, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Data Sources: Public online HRV and sleep datasets

gh repo clone Gussyric/Sleep_Pattern_System


Objectives
Use publicly available datasets to analyze HRV and sleep patterns.
Explore correlations between HRV variability and reported sleep quality.
Introduce fundamental data analysis techniques in physiological research.

Methodology
1. Data Collection
Gather HRV and sleep datasets from online sources.
Identify relevant features such as sleep duration, HRV metrics, and sleep quality scores.
2. Data Preprocessing
Clean and filter dataset (remove noise, handle missing values).
Normalize and structure data for analysis.
3. Data Analysis
Feature Extraction: Compute HRV metrics.
Statistical Analysis:
Descriptive statistics for HRV trends.
Correlation analysis between HRV and sleep quality.
Data visualization (HRV fluctuations across sleep cycles).
Results & Discussion
Key Findings: Trends in HRV across different sleep conditions.
Challenges: Data limitations, external factors influencing HRV.

Future Directions:
1. Expand dataset with additional sources.
2. Improve models for analyzing HRV variations.
3. Explore deeper statistical techniques for pattern recognition.

Deliverables
Final Report: Methodology, findings, and conclusions.
Data Visualizations: Graphs and charts on HRV trends.
Presentation: Summary for research events or class discussions.
